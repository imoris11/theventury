## Getting Started

To view the project, clone this repo and install the dependencies using yarn or npm.

Run `yarn install && yarn start` to install all dependencies and start the project on the default port.

## Responsiveness

The page was designed with a mobile first approach (default styles target smaller screens) using flexbox as the basis for responsiveness.

## Issues

When viewing the page using the mobile device on chrome, the page displays the desktop version. However, if the screen is resized manually the styles apply correctly.
